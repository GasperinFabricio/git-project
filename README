# Python Git Reimplementation (wyag-based)

## Project Purpose
This is an educational implementation of Git in Python, following the "wyag" (Write Yourself a Git) guide. The sole purpose is to deepen my understanding of Git's internals.

Git's internals are quite sketchy to understand thus the existence of this repo. 

If you also would like to implement this check the following link:

[wyag](wyag.thb.lt)

As the guide asks of the reader: Write it yourself, do not copy & paste and move on. Understanding is a thorough process, unlike a [burrito](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/).	

## Key Notes
- **Learning-focused**: Not intended for production use
- **Slow development**: Will be implemented gradually
- **Reference**: Based on the "wyag" guide's concepts

## Current Status
Early stage - foundational work in progress
